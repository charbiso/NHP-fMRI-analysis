# NHP-fMRI-analysis
These are bash and python scripts (both updated MrCat scripts and new scripts) that can be used to pre-process and analyse macaque 3T fMRI data files larger than 3000 volumes. The original MrCat scripts are limited
to approximately 1500 files.
If problems are encountered, you can send me a message.
